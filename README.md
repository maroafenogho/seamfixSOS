# SeamfixSOS

The SeamfixSOS app is a great way to securely send information of your current location when you have reasons to believe that you are in distress.
The app allows users take photos of their current location. The image captured is sent along with live location data and predefined SOS numbers to a secure 
database.
## Features

The project uses the following

* Retrofit for API integration,
* Google location API for live location information,
* CameraView Api for image capturing
